# AMCresultsAnalysis

**AMCresultsAnalysis** is a Python application designed to process the results of exams generated by AMC (Auto-Multiple-Choice). It analyzes the overall results and provides detailed information on each question, giving valuable insights for reviewing and improving the quality of assessments.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AMCresultsAnalysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd AMCresultsAnalysis
   ```

3. Edit the `settings.conf` file to customize the application according to your needs. It is strongly advised to set the path to the AMC Projects Directory in this file.

   ```text
    # Example settings.conf
   
    [DEFAULT]
    projects_dir = /Users/greg/Dropbox/01-QCM/_AMC/Projets-QCM
    openai.api_key =
    # number of students below which the discrimination indices are not calculated
    student_threshold = 90
    company_name = Print&Scan
    company_url = www.printandscan.fr

   ```

   - Set the `projects_dir` parameter to the path where your AMC projects are located.
   - You may optionally provide your OpenAI API Key if you want to obtain short explanations of the results. This step is not mandatory.

4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   If you prefer to create a virtual environment for this project, you can do so by following these steps:

   - Create a virtual environment:

     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     ```

   - Activate the virtual environment:

     - For Windows:

       ```bash
       .\env\Scripts\activate
       ```

     - For macOS/Linux:

       ```bash
       source env/bin/activate
       ```

   - Install the required dependencies:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   By using a virtual environment, you can keep the project dependencies isolated from your system's Python environment.

5. You are now ready to use the **AMCresultsAnalysis** application as described in the "Usage" section.

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python amcreport.py
   ```

2. The application will display a list of projects found in the specified projects directory. Select the desired project by entering the corresponding number.

3. The application will process the results of the selected project, generate a PDF report with charts, and save it in the project directory.

4. Once the report is generated, it will be opened using the default system PDF viewer.
